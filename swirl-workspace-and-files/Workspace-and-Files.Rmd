## Workspace and Files

If you need to understand how to affect your files and workspace from within RStudio and R, we recommend that you run this lesson directly within your own copy of RStudio by typing the following commands into the console:

1. `install.packages("swirl")` #You can skip this if you already installed swirl    

2. `library(swirl)`          

3. `swirl()`

4. Follow the instructions until you come to where you can select what you want to learn.

5. Choose `R Programming`.  

6. Choose `Lesson 2: Workspace and Files`.

After you have finished the lesson, please [continue from here](../swirl-sequences-of-numbers/).
