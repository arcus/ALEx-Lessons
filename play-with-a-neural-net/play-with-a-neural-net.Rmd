## We Shamelessly Link you to Someone Else's Work

Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter continued many people’s previous work (most notably Andrej Karpathy’s convnet.js demo and [Chris Olah’s articles about neural networks](http://colah.github.io)) to create **an online playground** where you can learn about and play with neural nets. 

### Um, what is a neural network? 

On their website, the authors say,

>It’s a technique for building a computer program that learns from data. It is based very loosely on how we think the human brain works. First, a collection of software “neurons” are created and connected together, allowing them to send messages to each other. Next, the network is asked to solve a problem, which it attempts to do over and over, each time strengthening the connections that lead to success and diminishing those that lead to failure. 

For a more detailed introduction to neural networks, [Michael Nielsen’s Neural Networks](Michael Nielsen’s Neural Networks and Deep Learning) (which is free!) is a good place to start. For a more technical overview, try [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) (which is also free!).


### How can I play with one?

Continuing a proud tradition of helping you benefit from other people's amazing work, [we happily link you to this playground so you can begin to learn about neural nets](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.08968&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) by having fun with them.
