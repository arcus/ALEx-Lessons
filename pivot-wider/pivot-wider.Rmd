This lesson is a partner to our [`pivot_longer` lesson](../pivot-longer/). We suggest you start with that one, as this lesson assumes you are familiar with basic `pivot` syntax.

## Background

This lesson is based on materials from the [`pivot` vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html). The goal of `pivot_wider` is to improve the usability of the old `spread` functions in the tidyverse. 

In the vignette, Hadley Wickham wrote this:

>For some time, it’s been obvious that there is something fundamentally wrong with the design of `spread()` and `gather()`. Many people don’t find the names intuitive and find it hard to remember which direction corresponds to spreading and which to gathering. It also seems surprisingly hard to remember the arguments to these functions, meaning that many people (including me!) have to consult the documentation every time.

The two pivot functions, [`pivot_longer`](../pivot-longer/) and `pivot_wider`, are the solution.

## The Problem that is not so Much of a Problem

Data is tidy when

1. Every column is a variable    
1. Every row is an observation    
1. Every cell is a single value

It’s relatively rare to need `pivot_wider` to make _tidy_ data, but it’s often useful for creating summary tables for presentation, or to put data into a format needed by other tools. 

## Examples

The `fish_encounters` dataset, contributed by [Myfanwy Johnston](https://fishsciences.github.io/post/visualizing-fish-encounter-histories/), describes when fish swimming down a river are detected by automatic monitoring stations. Type `fish_encounters` in the code block below.

```{r fishencounters-of-the-first-kind, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r fishencounters-of-the-first-kind-solution}
fish_encounters
```

Many tools used to analyze these data need it in a form in which each station is a column. The basic `pivot_wider` syntax is this:

>`pivot_wider(names_from = var1, values_from = var2)`

This process is a bit like creating dummy variables with 1s & 0s when you want all your regression input to be scalar in one form or another (see our [Correlation and Regression lesson](../correlation-and-regression/) to learn more). 

Basically, you figure out which new variables you want from the _levels_ of variables that are already present in the data set. That's where you get your new variables _names from_. Then you figure out where the values for those new variables are stored before the pivot, and you tell `pivot_wider` that's where you want the _values from_. `pivot_wider` creates new variables and populates them with data from the variable you told it to take the values from.

You'll end up with more columns and fewer rows in the data set.

Let's try it with the `fish_encounters` data set. [Pipe](../piping-and-summarizing/) the data set to `pivot_wider` and tell it to take the `names_from` the `station` variable and the `values_from` `seen`. Use the hints if you have trouble.

First, though, change all the names to lowercase using the statement `names(fish_encounters) <- tolower(names(fish_encounters))`. 

```{r changefishyformats, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}

```
```{r changefishyformats-hint-1}
names(fish_encounters) <- tolower(names(...))
fish_encounters %>% ...
```
```{r changefishyformats-hint-2}
names(fish_encounters) <- tolower(names(fish_encounters))
fish_encounters %>% 
  pivot_wider(...)
```
```{r changefishyformats-hint-3}
names(fish_encounters) <- tolower(names(fish_encounters))
fish_encounters %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = station, 
              values_from = ...)
```
```{r changefishyformats-solution}
names(fish_encounters) <- tolower(names(fish_encounters))
fish_encounters %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = station, 
              values_from = seen)
```


```{r arrangevars, echo = FALSE}
library(sortable)
var_order <- c(
  "tagid",
  "Release",
  "I80_1",
  "Lisbon",
  "Rstr",
  "Base_TD",
  "BCE",
  "BCW",
  "BCE2",
  "BCW2",
  "MAE",
  "MAW"
  )
# Initialize the question
question_rank(
  "Please arrange these variable names into the order you have in your output from the previous code chunk. If you see variables you don't have in your output, or if you have strange characters in your output, have another go at the code.",
  answer(var_order, correct = TRUE),
  answer(rev(var_order), correct = FALSE, message = "Other direction."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Let's walk through another practical example using census data from the `tidycensus` package. Specifically, we'll look at the dataset `us_rent_income`. First, type the name of the data set to see what it looks like.

```{r tidycensus, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r tidycensus-solution}
us_rent_income
```

The `us_rent_income` dataset contains information about median income and rent for each state in the US for 2017 (from the American Community Survey).

Both `estimate` and `moe` are values columns, so we can supply them to `values_from` in a `pivot_wider` call. 

Use piping to do this. Start with the dataset `us_rent_income` and let the results print to the console. Specifically, 

1. Start with `us_rent_income` and a pipe operator  
1. Call `pivot_wider` with the following arguments
   - `names_from` set equal to the variable that contains the two values "rent" and "income"
   - `values_from` set equal to a concatenation of the variable that contains estimates and the variable `moe`

```{r rent-income-piped-once, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r rent-income-piped-once-hint-1}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(...)
```
```{r rent-income-piped-once-hint-2}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(.., ...)
```
```{r rent-income-piped-once-hint-3}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, ...)
```
```{r rent-income-piped-once-hint-4}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = c(...))
```
```{r rent-income-piped-once-solution}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate, moe))
```

```{r estimate, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the estimated income for Connecticut?",
         answer("35326", correct = TRUE),
         answer("24476"),
         answer("25952"),
         answer("31560"),
         correct = "Yes, that's the income I was looking for.",
         incorrect = "Sorry, you're looking at the wrong row or your `pivot_wider` command has given some odd output.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Now that you understand the basics of `pivot_wider`, you can do some more exploring on your own.
