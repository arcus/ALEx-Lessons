### Your data goes here. It's best to put the entire data set as text in this setup code chunk.
# That way, it's available to all the code chunks that follow.
# What happens in a code chunk stays in a code chunk, not to be see by other code chunks--unless
# you did it in the setup code chunk as well.

## Installing the `learnr` Package for Interactive Lessons

RStudio has a wonderful package for interactive lessons with quiz questions and interactive R code called `learnr`. 

We use a forked version of the `learnr` package here at [CHOP's Arcus Learning Exchange](https://alex.arcus.chop.edu) that allows us to write interactive lessons with code chunks in     

  * R    
  * Python    
  * SQL    

You can download the version we use for your own system by following these commands:

```{r download-zoe-learnr, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("zoews/learnr")
```

Once you've done that, you have the package that allows you to create interactive lessons in R, Python, SQL, and, later, any number of other languages. 

We recommend the use of this package only for ALEx lessons. Our servers are protected from [Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) hacks. If you plan to deploy interactive lessons on your own server, you might want to use the original `learnr` package and limit your interactive code chunks to the R language. RStudio may release their own multi-language `learnr` at some point. Meanwhile, caveat emptor!

```{r bobby-tables, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/bobby-tables.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```


## What's an Interactive Lesson?

An interactive lesson requires the user not simply to read text or watch videos, but also to respond to questions or try out the steps themselves in code chunks that work. Leaners therefore don't need to have R or RStudio (or Python, or SQL) installed to run their code and see how well it works. For an example, try our [R Basic Building Blocks](../swirl-basic-building-blocks/) lesson. 

`learnr` requires specific yaml and setup code. For the Arcus Learning Exchange, please use the code as shown here:

```{r yaml-and-setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/yaml-and-setup.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

## Rules of Headers and Interactive Code Chunks

The following sections provide information about which headers to use and how to create interactive code chunks.

## Double-Hashtag Headers

Double-hashtag headers are written 

>\## I am a Double-Hashtag Header

but they look like

>## This

Create an informative header and write some informative text two lines below it. Always separate paragraphs with an extra line.

### Triple-Hashtag Headers

This level of header may appear at the top of the window (if you have two or more of them), but everything back to the previous double-hashtag header is still on the page. You can scroll up to see it. The "Continue" button either opens up more text on this page if the next section is triple-hashtag headed, or opens a new page if the next section is double-hashtag headed.

## Quiz Questions and Exercises

You can interact with learners using quiz questions and coding exercises. In the following sections, we provide you with examples of how to write quizzes and exercises and show you what that code presents to the user. 

### Quiz Question

You can write a quiz question using a special code chunk that looks like this:

```{r quizquestion, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/quizquestion.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

To see how your lesson will look at runtime, click on "Run Document" at the top of the RStudio window.

```{r rundocument, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/rundocument.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```


The quiz question code chunk looks like this after you run your document:

```{r label, echo=FALSE}
question("question",
         answer("first_answer", correct = TRUE),
         answer("second_answer", message = "message_wrong_1"),
         answer("third_answer", message = "message_wrong_2"),
         answer("fourth_answer", message = "message_wrong_3"),
         correct = "correct_feedback",
         incorrect = "incorrect_feedback",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Exercise with One Hint

You might want to present a simple coding exercise in any of our supported languages. 

Here is how to write an exericse to give the learner a simple exercise in R and provide them with a single hint:

```{r firstcodechunk, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/firstcodechunk.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

The above code produces this interactive code box:

```{r name, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r name-hint}
x <- ?
```
```{r name-solution}
x <- 1
```

It has two so-called hints because the final hint is the solution. 

### Exericse in Python with One Hint

To create an exercise in a different language, simply change the object that follow the `{` from `r` to `python` or `sql`. 

For example, this Python code chunk asks the learner to create Python code to check if x is less than or equal to 4. No hints are provided---just the solution.

```{r pythoncodechunk, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/pythoncodechunk.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Here is what that resolves to when you run the document:

```{python pythonchunk, python.reticulate = FALSE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{python pythonchunk-solution, python.reticulate = FALSE}
x = 5
x < -4
```

### Coding Exercise in SQL with One Hint

### Coding Exercise in R with Two Hints

It's easy to add additional hints. Here is an example in R code:

```{r rcodetwohints, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/rcodetwohints.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

And this is what the learner sees as a result of the above code:

```{r name2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r name2-hint-1}
x <- 1
y <- ?
```
```{r name2-hint-2}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- ?
```
```{r name2-solution}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
```

As you can see, we add hints by adding new code chunks in the sequence. 

### Coding Exercise in R with Three Hints

Here is a coding question in R that requires three hints:

```{r name3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}

```
```{r name3-hint-1}
x <- ?
```
```{r name3-hint-2}
x <- 1
y <- ?
```
```{r name3-hint-3}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- ?
```
```{r name3-solution}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
```

### Coding Exercise in R with Four Hints

With a complex, 4-hint coding question:

```{r name4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 15}

```
```{r name4-hint-1}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
xyz2 <- (x + y + z) ^ 2
```
```{r name4-hint-2}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
xyz2 <- (x + y + z) ^ 2
```
```{r name4-hint-3}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
xyz2 <- (x + y + z) ^ 2
```
```{r name4-hint-4}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
xyz2 <- (x + y + z) ^ 2
```
```{r name4-solution}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- 3
xyz <- x + y + z
xyz2 <- (x + y + z) ^ 2
```

## Exercise Examples with All Available Languages

In these sections you will find examples SQL, R, and Python coding exercises. 

### A Simple SQL Exercise

Here is the code for an exercise in SQL:

```{r sqlexercise, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/sqlexercise.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Go ahead and run the code if you like. You can also try other SQL commands in this code box. 

```{r setup2, include=FALSE}
# altered from https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/05-r-and-databases.html
mammals <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),
                          "www/portal_mammals.sqlite")
```
```{sql sql-not-r, exercise = TRUE, connection="mammals", output.var='surveys', exercise.lines = 15}
SELECT *
FROM `surveys`
LIMIT 10
```

### The Same Code in R and Python---with Different Results

The following code exercises run code that looks the same in either R or Python but results in different outcomes.  The R code chunk evaluates to 10 and the Python code chunk evaluates to `False` and 5.

```{r agnostic, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/agnostic.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

You can try running these code chunks here:

```{r r-not-python-check}
r_answer <- 10
```
```{r r-not-python-code-check}
x = 5
x <-10
print(x)
```
```{r r-not-python, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
# if running in R, this should return 10
# if running in Python, this should return FALSE and 5
x = 5
x <-10
print(x)
```

```{python python-not-r-check, python.reticulate = FALSE}
r_answer <- list(FALSE, 5)
```
```{python python-not-r-code-check, python.reticulate = FALSE}
x = 5
x <-10
print(x)
```
```{python python-not-r, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# if running in R, this should return 10
# if running in Python, this should return FALSE and 5
x = 5
x <-10
print(x)
```
