Warning: This is a spare lesson, as Git lessons go. We'll tell you how to do things properly, but we're not going to tell you everything you _can_ do---until later. 

In this lesson, you will learn how to type things like `git commit -m "my log message here."` (among other Git commands) and know what it means. 

Later, you will learn things like this:

```{r everything, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/everything.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Prepare yourself. As Jenny Bryan (whom we quote assiduously within) wrote, "It's not you, it's Git."

## Install Git

You need Git so you can use it at the command line and so RStudio can call it.

#### Is it already, miraculously, installed on your system?

If there’s any chance it’s installed already, verify that, rejoice, and skip the rest of the "Install Git" section.

```{r checkgitinstalled, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/checkgitinstalled.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

If, instead, you see something more like `git: command not found`, keep reading.

macOS users might get an immediate offer to install command line developer tools. Yes, you should accept! Click `Install` and carry on.

Windows Users (highly recommended): Install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), also known as `msysgit` or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing, but you might encounter them elsewhere and we want you to be well informed.

We like this because Git for Windows leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the “Git Bash” shell will be useful as you venture outside of R within RStudio.

NOTE: When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults.
Note also that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.

Installing this way also leaves you with a Git client, though not a very good one. So check out [Git clients we recommend](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html#git-client).

If you were not able to download and install Git, I highly recommend following [Jenny Bryan's instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html). They are uniquely simple and clear. 

FYI, this appears to be equivalent to what you would download from here: https://git-scm.com/download/.

## What you Need for this Lesson

1. An open [shell (a.k.a. "terminal")](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it) like this one:  

```{r github, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("www/terminal.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. Data, which I have loaded for you in the tibble `scores`. Type `scores` and run the code to see what's in it. 

```{r scores-see-ha-ha, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r scores-see-ha-ha-solution}
scores
```

3. R and RStudio installed and usable on your system. If you haven't already gotten this software ready, follow the instructions in [Set Up R](../sb-set-up-r/).

We'll use your shell and the data to work through some Git basics. We will also open the data file in RStudio.


## `git init`: Make a New Repo and Put Something in It

1. Place yourself in a directory where you can create another directory that you'll make into a Git "repository" or, as many people say, "repo." I like to put all my repos in the folder `GitHub`, which resides in `Documents` on my computer. 

```{r myshell, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/github.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. From your shell, create a directory called `scores` and navigate into it. It should be empty.

```{r mkdir, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/mkdir.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Now execute this Git command:

3. `git init`    

**NOTE**: You can also create a directory while initializing it by sitting in the parent directory of your as-yet-unmade one and typing `git init my_new_directory`. 

Next, see what's in the directory. Specifically, look for the directory `.git`. 

4. `ls` 
5. `ls *.git`

```{r gitinitgitadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitinitgitadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

6. You're sitting in empty directory, right? `cd` into `.git`, which seems not to be there, just to see if you can. 

```{r finditanyway, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/finditanyway.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Of course you can. 

8. Let's go back into RStudio. Save `scores` as "scores.csv" in your lovely new repo using the command `write.csv(scores, "/your_path_here/scores.csv")`.

You have a repo that has something in it. Well done. 

I have a really cool shell setup called [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). The prompt changes to include not only my directory's name, but also the fact that I'm in a Git repo, which branch of the repo I'm currently using (the `master` branch---and more about branches later), and whether or not I have uncommitted material in the repo (see the ex?).  

```{r iTerm2, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/iTerm2.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NA)
```

## `git add`: Preparing for a `commit`

Use `git add` to tell Git which files you want to include in the next `commit`. I could go into a lot of detail about indices and how Git's guts interpret `add`, but let's just not. Git's guts are frankly rather frightening. You don't need to know about them yet. Use [Git's documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) if you want more detail---but first, brace yourself.

The easiest syntax to use from the command line is plain old `git add .`, where the dot means "everything". In your head, you would say, "Git, add everything that has changed since the last time I added things." You can replace the dot with specific file names if you need to. Most of the time, though, you won't. 

```{r gitadddot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitadddot.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Notice that my ex didn't go away. That's because there are changes in the directory that I haven't committed yet.

## `git commit`: Advance a Repo

The `git commit` command records changes to the repo. 

#### Do it Right

Let's try it. Follow these steps:

1. If you are following this tutorial, you already told Git that there is new stuff in the repo by typing `git add .`

```{r goodadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/goodadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. Type `git commit -m"Added the data file."` (you can put a space between `-m` and the message if you like; it doesn't matter).

```{r commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/commit.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

You should fall gracefully to the next command line, with new information provided to you along the way, but without any error messages. And did you notice that my ex went away? That's because the local repo is up to date with the remote repo.

#### Do it Wrong

This is what happens when you commit without first telling Git that you have added things:

```{r forgotadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/forgotadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

And this is what happens if you forget to send a message for the log along with your `commit`:

```{r prep-to-commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/oops.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Inside an editor with _no_ instructions on how to edit anything (only a demand that you do), _no_ instructions on how to leave, and a powerful sense that if you mess this up, you will hurt your repo: this is one of the worst places to end up in all of coding.

Just don't go there. Use `git commit -m "your message here"` to add a message without being shunted to the editor.

## `git branch` and `git checkout`: Switching Branches

"What's a branch?" You say.

It's a mysterious concept you're supposed to just git, say I. Ha.

#### Branching

Many people have gotten this far and begun to collapse into confusion because terms like "branch" are used by kindly developers all over the internet with nary a definition in sight.

The problem is that the metaphors are all mixed up. A branch is actually about wood and trees and growing things, but here we must view it as being about the flow of time (yes, flowing branches). 

We tell Git to keep track of things for us, and Git obliges by creating a history of our changes. It takes snapshots of whatever we tell it to `add` and `commit`. If you lay those snapshots one above another, consecutively, you get a sort of tree. Right? You aren't actually copying files anywhere; you are keeping track of how they have changed so you could, should you need to, reconstruct a prior version of the file stored further down on the branch. So don't think wood so much as geneology where all the parents are single. 

Right now, we have only one branch. Find it by typing `git show-branch`. Git will show you all the branches and the commits that have been applied to them. 

It might not surprise you to find out that our tree is extremely simple. Go ahead, try it. 

```{r gitshowbranch, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitshowbranch.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

See? One branch called "master" (to bring in _yet another_ metaphor), which has seen a single commit (remember doing that `git commit` just before you got to this section? That commit). 

Here is what Jenny Bryan & Co. say about branches: "Branches afford explicit workflows for integrating different lines of work on your own terms. This is much nicer than trying to do a tricky merge or rebase in a frustrated panic, because you need to `push` your work to GitHub at the end of the day." We haven't encountered `push` yet, but in other words, if people make major changes on branches, the master branch can stay as it is until everyone is sure the changes on other branches are worth keeping. The branches still track the history of files, but in a different place from where the master branch has it. You can merge branches at will. Well, the person(s) who own(s) the parent branch (in our case, the master branch) can. But we'll get to that later.

```{r whatsabranch, echo=FALSE}
question("What's a branch? Pick two.",
         answer("It grows from trees.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("It's a line of work, as tracked by Git, that doesn't mix with other lines of work unless you tell it to", correct = TRUE),
         answer("It's a Git command that sends your changes to the remote file location."),
         answer("It's a way of telling Git that you want to know what your files looked like yesterday."),
     correct = "Well done.",
     incorrect = "There are other commands, like `git push`, `git pull`, and `git diff`, that we haven't discussed yet.",
     random_answer_order = TRUE,
     allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

According to Bryan et al., Branching means that you take a "detour" from the main "stream" of development (oh, the metaphors!) and do work without changing the main "stream". 

```{r selecttruthaboutbranches, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of the following are true about branching?",
         answer("It allows one or many people to work in parallel without overwriting each other’s work.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("It means lots of people on the same project can have their work under version control without having to merge everything together.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("It exists to confuse us.", message = "It might seem that way, but no."),
         answer("It means everyone on the project has agreed to keep what is on each branch.", message = "Actually, branching allows for the opposite of this."),
     correct = "Cheers! You got it right.",
     incorrect = "No.",
     random_answer_order = TRUE,
     allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Creating a branch and switching between branches is nearly instantaneous. Git's handling of branches encourages workflows in which you create small branches for exploration or for new features and  `merge` them back together quickly and accurately.

#### Checking out Branches

"What does it mean to check something out in Git?" you say.

One web resource said, "It is the process that works to checking out previous commits and files in which the current working folder is updated to get equality on a selected branch."

>Huh?

Let's try again. "`git-slam-branch` (for instance) slams a few non-stashed remote branches outside all failed downstream origins, and after a `git-terrorize-ref` (logged by `git-transform-object`) remotes a subtree, unsuccessfully imported tips are prevented for the user, and trees that were `quiltimported` during initializing are left in a cloned state."

Okay, okay, I confess: That one came from the [Git Man (Manual) Page Generator](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/#c552ac17bee01f2fd7fcb4d523bb45ca), which is actually a bit better than the Git documentation found on your computer and mine.

Back to the question at hand: What _is_ `git checkout`?

>"You use `git checkout` to switch between branches" (Jenny Bryan of [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com)).

Oooooh. Okay. Now _that_ makes sense.

You can create a new branch with `git branch`, then `checkout` the branch with `git checkout`. You can also use the shortcut 

>`git checkout -b issue-5` 

to create _and_ `checkout` the branch all at once. We'll talk more about checking out stuff in a minute.

Meanwhile---what do you do if you are working on a branch and need to switch, but the work on the current branch is not complete? 

One option is `git stash` (which we can look at later), but generally, a better option is to safeguard the current state with a temporary `commit`. 

Here I use “WIP” as the commit message to indicate **w**ork **i**n **p**rogress.

```{r small-commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/small-commit.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

So you've committed that, and gone off and made some changes on the master branch and committed _them_, thus:

```{r fiddleelsewhere, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/fiddleelsewhere.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

...and now you want to come back to the _first_ branch and pick up where you left off, pretending you never committed. 

You want, in fact, to undo the commit you just did and pretend it never happened. Read on to learn how to use `git reset` to do that.

## `git reset`: Undoing Changes

You are sitting in a branch that you saved by `commit`ting it before you actaully wanted to. How do you undo that commit? 

Well, you don't actually "undo" it. You `git reset` it. 

Here, we check out the branch we made in the [previous section of this tutorial](http://a-mess.org/sb-git-for-individual-developers/#section-git-checkout-and-git-branch-switching-branches). 

When you come back to the branch and continue your work, you need to undo the temporary commit by `reset`ting your state. Specifically, we want a mixed reset, but we have so many mixed metaphors that we'll just call it a reset for now. A reset peels off the temporary "WIP" commit we made in the [previous section](http://a-mess.org/sb-git-for-individual-developers/#section-git-checkout-and-git-branch-switching-branches). 

Use the reference `HEAD^` to roll the commit state back to the parent (HEAD) of the current commit. 

Why do we have a parent named "HEAD"? Why do we not call the parent "PARENT"? Because that would be waaay too consistent. This is Git, where the metaphors are always mixed. 

Just . . . just go with it. 

```{r git-reset-head, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/git-reset-head.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

And there you are, back to the _exact_ state you were in before you had to rush off and do something on another branch. 

## `git log`: What Have I Done?

So you just inherited this project from someone else and you were told to roll back a feature. How do you figure out when it was introduced and how you might (later) go back to before that?

I typed `git log` and my shell changed to show me this:

```{r oursimplelog, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/oursimplelog.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

You might have to press `ctrl-z` to get back to the command line. I did.

This log says that we committed once on Christmas Eve 2019 at 8 past 4 in the afternoon eastern time and that we said the commit "added the data file." 

Some logs are complicated. For complex projects you probably want to install a Git client such as those listed [here](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html). Most of them keep the log available to you at all times as a sort of map, like this (scroll right to see all of it):

```{r pretty-git-kraken, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/pretty-git-kraken.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

## `git diff` and `git status`: Seeing what you're Doing

`git diff` shows you what changed, thus:

```{r git-diff, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/git-diff.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Consider version A of a file and a modified version, version B. Assume that version A was part of one Git commit and version B was part of the next commit. **The set of differences between A and B is called a “diff”**. 

Git users contemplate diffs a lot. Diff inspection is how you re-explain to yourself how version A differs from version B. Diff inspection is not limited to adjacent commits. You can inspect the diffs between any two commits.

In fact, Git’s notion of any specific version of a document, code, or data asset is as an accumulation of diffs. If you go back far enough, you find the commit where the file was created in the first place. Every later version is stored by Git as that initial version plus all the intervening diffs in the history that affect the file.

Another way to look at changes is to check the `status` of your repo. I used `git status` in this repo twice, once before and once after I created `another_file`. 

```{r git-status-b4-and-4b, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/git-status-b4-and-4b.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

## Merging Local Branches

Here is how you merge:

```{r git-merge, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/git-merge.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

If I wasn't up to date, Git would have opened a file for me to save a comment about the merge. When that happens, you can add a note and save the file, thus completing the merge. The result, from `git log`, is this:

```{r git-log-of-merge, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/git-log-of-merge.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

If you are still having issues with Git dumping you into a line editor that you don't know how to use, see [this set of instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)---from Jenny Bryan, of course. At the bottom of the page is how to configure a Git editor. Emacs is a bit easier to use than whatever the default editor is for, say, macOS. You can write in an Emacs editor and save what you wrote without having to both do something unintuitive and also deal with the fact that is no user interface or instruction, anywhere.

## Some Helpful Videos

I like [this video](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn-git#beginner) about using Git with GitKraken, a rather nice user interface that functions a bit like RStudio does with R: It isn't the actual software, but it is a very nice way of interfacing with the software. 

GitKraken's videos build on vocabulary you already know even if you know nothing at all about Git. The first part of every tutorial is a good explanation of a Git concept. The end of each video is a demo of how you can use what you just learned and do something in GitKraken. Skip the bits about GitKraken at the end if you like, or consider using GitKraken to manage your files with Git.
