Warning: This is a spare lesson, as Git lessons go. We'll tell you how to do things properly, but we're not going to tell you everything you _can_ do---until later. 

In this lesson, you will learn how to type things like `git commit -m "my log message here."` (among other git commands) and know what it means. 

Later, you will learn things like this:

```{r everything, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/everything.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

## Install Git

You need Git so you can use it at the command line and so RStudio can call it.

### Is it already, miraculously, installed on your system?

If there’s any chance it’s installed already, verify that, rejoice, and skip the rest of the "Install Git" section.

```{r checkgitinstalled, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/checkgitinstalled.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

If, instead, you see something more like `git: command not found`, keep reading.

macOS users might get an immediate offer to install command line developer tools. Yes, you should accept! Click `Install` and carry on.

Windows Users Option 1 (highly recommended): Install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), also known as `msysgit` or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing, but you might encounter them elsewhere and we want you to be well informed.

We like this because Git for Windows leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the “Git Bash” shell will be useful as you venture outside of R within RStudio.

NOTE: When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults.
Note also that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.

This also leaves you with a Git client, though not a very good one. So check out [Git clients we recommend](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html#git-client).

FYI, this appears to be equivalent to what you would download from here: https://git-scm.com/download/.

## What you Need for this Lesson

1. An open [shell (a.k.a. "terminal")](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it) like this one:  

```{r github, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("www/terminal.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. Data, which I have loaded for you in the tibble `scores`. Type `scores` and run the code to see what's in it. 

```{r scores-see-ha-ha, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r scores-see-ha-ha-solution}
scores
```


We'll use your shell and the data to work through some Git basics.


## `git init`: Make a New Repo and Put Something in It

1. Place yourself in a directory where you can create another directory that you'll make into a Git "repository" or, as many people say, "repo." I like to put all my repos in the folder `GitHub`, which resides in `Documents` on my computer. 

```{r myshell, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/github.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

From your shell, create a directory called `scores` and navigate into it. It should be empty.

```{r mkdir, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/mkdir.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Now execute this Git command:

1. `git init`    

NOTE: You can also create a directory while initializing it by sitting in the parent directory of your as-yet-unmade one and typing `git init my_new_directory`. 

Next, see what's in the directory. Specifically, look for the directory `.git`. 

2. `ls` 
3. `ls *.git`

```{r gitinitgitadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitinitgitadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

You're sitting in empty directory, right? `cd` into `.git`, which seems not to be there, just to see if you can. 

```{r finditanyway, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/finditanyway.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Of course you can. 

Now let's go back into RStudio. Save `scores` as "scores.csv" in your lovely new repo using the command `write.csv(scores, "/your_path_here/scores.csv")`.

Now you have a repo that has something in it. Well done. 

I have a really cool shell setup called [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). The prompt changes to include not only my directory's name, but also the fact that I'm in a Git repo, which branch of the repo I'm currently using (the `master` branch---and more about branches later), and whether or not I have uncommitted material in the repo (see the ex?).  

```{r iTerm2, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/iTerm2.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NA)
```

## `git add`: Preparing for a `commit`

Use `git add` to tell Git which files you want to include in the next `commit`. I could go into a lot of detail about indices and how Git's guts interpret `add`, but let's just not. Git's guts are frankly rather frightening. You don't need to know about them yet. Use [Git's documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) if you want more detail---but first, brace yourself.

The easiest syntax to use from the command line is plain old `git add .`, where the dot means "everything". In your head, you would say, "Git, add everything that has changed since the last time I added things." You can replace the dot with specific file names if you need to. Most of the time, though, you won't. 

```{r gitadddot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitadddot.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Notice that my ex didn't go away. That's because there are changes in the directory that I haven't committed yet.

## `git commit`: Advance a Repo

The `git commit` command records changes to the repo. 

### Do it Right

Let's try it. Follow these steps:

1. If you are following this tutorial, you already told Git that there is new stuff in the repo by typing `git add .`

```{r goodadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/goodadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. Type `git commit -m"Added the data file."` (you can put a space between `-m` and the message if you like; it doesn't matter).

```{r commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/commit.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

You should fall gracefully to the next command line, with new information provided to you along the way, but without any error messages.

### Do it Wrong

This is what happens when you commit without first telling Git that you have added things:

```{r forgotadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/forgotadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

And this is what happens if you forget to send a message for the log along with your `commit`:

```{r prep-to-commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/oops.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Inside an editor with _no_ instructions on how to edit anything (only a demand that you do), _no_ instructions on how to leave, and a powerful sense that if you mess this up, you will hurt your repo: this is one of the worst places to end up in all of coding.

Just don't go there. Use `git commit -m "your message here"` to add a message without being shunted to the editor.

## `git checkout` and `git branch`: Switching Branches

"What's a branch?" You say.

It's a mysterious concept you're supposed to just git, say I. Ha.

Many people have gotten this far and begun to collapse into confusion because terms like "branch" are used by kindly developers all over the internet with nary a definition in sight. It's why courses like this one are still necessary. 

The problem is that the metaphors are all mixed up. A branch is actually about time, and we're supposed to view it as a sort of tree. We have told Git to keep track of things for us, and Git has obliged. It is creating a history of changes by taking little snapshots of whatever we tell it to add. If you lay those snapshots one above another, well, you get a sort of tree. Right? And you can create alternative histories, like one for your development phase and one for your release phase, and those alternative histories are called branches. 

Just go with it. 

Right now we have only one branch. Find it by typing `git show-branch`. Git will show you all the branches and the commits that have been applied to them. It might not surprise you to find out that our tree is extremely simple. Go ahead, try it. 

```{r gitshowbranch, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitshowbranch.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

See? One branch called "master" (to bring in _yet another_ metaphor), which has seen a single commit (remember doing that `git commit` just before you got here? That one).

## Some Helpful Videos

I like [this video](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn-git#beginner) about using Git with GitKraken, a rather nice user interface that functions a bit like RStudio does with R: It isn't the actual software, but it is a very nice way of interfacing with the software. 

GitKraken's videos build on vocabulary you already know even if you know nothing at all about Git. The first part of every tutorial is a good explanation of a Git concept. The end of each video is a demo of how you can use what you just learned and do something in GitKraken. Skip the bits about GitKraken at the end if you like, or consider using GitKraken to manage your files with Git.
