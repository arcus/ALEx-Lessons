## A Famous Motivating Example
#### (Perhaps surprisingly, this example is still relevant)

```{r galtonjpg, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/Francis_Galton.jpg", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

```{r Galton-height-regress, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/Galton-height-regress.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

This is the first lesson on Regression Models. We'll begin with the concept of "regression toward the mean" and illustrate it with some pioneering work of the father of forensic science (and eugenics, just so we don't get carried away with admiration), Sir Francis Galton. That's his picture at the top, along with a graph he drew of the data we're about to examine. 

Yeah, computer screens are a lot easier to read than old paper with fountain pen ink duplicated through the ages. 

Sir Francis studied the relationship between
heights of parents and their children. His work
showed that parents who were taller than average
had children who were also tall but closer to
the average height. Similarly, parents who were
shorter than average had children who were also
shorter than average but less so than mom and
dad. That is, they were closer to the average
height. From one generation to the next the
heights moved closer to the average or regressed
toward the mean.

For this lesson we'll use Sir Francis's
parent-child height data which we've taken the
liberty to load for you as the variable `galton`.

So
let's get started!

## Galton's Data

Loaded for you in memory is Galton's data, a set of 928
parent-child height pairs. Take a look at it by typing `galton` at the command line. Then click Run Code or press cmd-Enter (for a Mac) or ctrl-Enter (for a PC).

```{r type-galton, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r type-galton-solution}
galton
```


```{r howmanycases, echo=FALSE}
question("How many cases are there in the `galton` data set?",
         answer("928", correct = TRUE),
         answer("932", message = "That's too high."),
         answer("500", message = "That's too low."),
         answer("12", message = "That's way too low."),
         correct = "That's right!",
         incorrect = "Try looking at the output from when you looked at the `galton` data set.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Now try plotting it, using the `plot` command and passing it nothing but `galton`. 

```{r plotgalton, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r plotgalton-hint}
plot(...)
```
```{r plotgalton-solution}
plot(galton)
```

Note that base R (the functions available to you if you don't load any packages in the library) has a `plot` function that very cleverly decides which plot makes the most sense given the data you passed it.

```{r numberofdots, echo=FALSE}
question("True or False: The above plot has 928 dots.",
         answer("False", correct = TRUE),
         answer("True", message = "Look again."),
         correct = "Correct.",
         incorrect = "No.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Moms' and dads' heights were averaged together (after moms' heights were adjusted by a factor of 1.08). Let's use the R function `jitter` on the children's heights to highlight heights that occurred most frequently. To do that, we must explicate the variables we're sending to `plot`.

To specify _exactly_ what to plot, rather than relying on plot to figure it out, you would normally type a formula followed by the name of the dataset. This might look something like `plot(child ~ parent, galton)`, which, in English, is "Plot the child variable across the parent variable, and by the way, those two variables come from the `galton` dataset. 

In order to see values that have a greater number of dots, `jitter` either `child`, `parent`, or both by replacing the variable, say, `child`, with `jitter(child)`. Play around to see which variable or variables you prefer to jitter. You can even jitter both of them.


```{r jitterplot, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r jitterplot-hint-1}
plot(..., galton)
```
```{r jitterplot-solution}
plot(jitter(child) ~ parent, galton)
```

Now let's add a red 45-degree line of slope 1 and intercept 0 to the plot. This is done using the `abline` function. First plot the data with the jitters, as you did above, then add another line of code: `abline(0, 1, col = "red")`. Just to make sure you can see the dots clear, let's set the jitter value manually, to 4.

```{r addabline, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}

```
```{r addabline-hint-1}
plot(..., galton)
abline(..., ...)
```
```{r addabline-hint-2}
plot(jitter(child, ...) ~ parent, galton)
abline(..., ...)
```
```{r addabline-hint-3}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, ...)
```
```{r addabline-solution}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
```

If children tended to be the same heights as their parents, we would expect the data to vary evenly about the red line. But that happens only at around the middle of the data set.

```{r rpdense, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the relationship of the density of the dots to the 45-degree line?",
         answer("To the left, children's heights tend to be above the line, whereas to the right, they tend to be below the line.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The children's heights vary evenly about the line."),
         answer("To the right, children's heights tend to be below the line, whereas to the right, they tend to be above the line."),
         correct = "You got it!",
         incorrect = "Not quite. Try counting and comparing the number of dots above and below the lowest and highest parent height values.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Your First Regression Line

Now let's make a linear (straight) regression line. That's the line which has the minimum variation of the data around it. To put it another way, it's the line that goes the closest to the most dots.

For now, we'll stick with a straight line (you can get fancy about the shapes of your lines---and should, sometimes---but that's a lesson for another day).

Making a regression line is quite easy in R. The
function `lm` (linear model) makes one for you. It needs a `formula` and `dataset`. You can type `?formula` for more information, but, in simple
terms, we just need to specify the dependent variable
(children's heights, or `child`) `~` the independent variable (parents'
heights, or `parent`). Then tell `lm` that you're working with the `galton` data set.

That will put all the information we need about the line into memory. We'll draw it in the next step.

```{r regrline, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r regrline-hint-1}
regrline <- ?
```
```{r regrline-hint-2}
regrline <- lm(...)
```
```{r regrline-hint-3}
regrline <- lm(..., galton)
```
```{r regrline-solution}
(regrline <- lm(child ~ parent, galton))
```

You won't see any information about the line unless you surround the statement with parentheses. If you do, you will see that we have an intercept and a slope---like our earlier intercept (0) and slope (1), only different, because this line was calculated from the data rather than from an idea in our heads.

Now we add `regrline` to the plot using the same method we used before, `abline`. Type `abline(regrline, lwd = 3, col = "red")`. `lwd` is the line width, and `col`, as you probably already figured out, is color. You can copy your previous plotting code from above and substitute the correct values.

```{r plotregrline, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 15}

```
```{r plotregrline-hint-1}
plot(...)
abline(...)
abline(...)
```
```{r plotregrline-hint-2}
plot(jitter(...) ~ parent, galton)
abline(...)
abline(...)
```
```{r plotregrline-hint-3}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(...)
abline(...)
```
```{r plotregrline-hint-4}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
abline(...)
```
```{r plotregrline-solution}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
abline(regrline, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
```

Note that the blue line seems to find the middle of each parent-child height relationship fairly accurately. Any deviation is due to the fact that we haven't allowed it to stop being a straight line. (It's tempting to start playing around here with line types, but I'll refrain. Another day, another lesson!)

The blue line's slope is greater than zero (which would be horizontal), which means that parents' heights _relate_ to their children's. The slope is also less than 1 (which would be the 45-degree angle we already drew), as would have been the case if children tended to be the _same_ height as their parents. 

The regression line will have a slope and intercept which are
estimated from data. Estimates are not exact. Their accuracy
is gauged by theoretical techniques and expressed in terms of
"standard error." You can use `summary(regrline)` to examine
the Galton regression line. Do this now.

```{r summaryregrline, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r summaryregrline-solution}
summary(regrline)
```

The slope of the line is the estimate of the coefficient, or multiplier, of `parent`, and the independent variable of our data (in this case, the parents' heights).

What this means is that if you take a child's height and multiply it by the coefficient of parent, you have the best possible (not perfect) chance of getting close to the child's height. This will be true for the largest possible number of children in your data set. 

Obviously, it's not perfect. If we calculated each child's height using parents' heights and the correlation coefficient, almost every one of our estimates would be wrong. That's a flaw in regression that we forget at our peril. But the regression line does the best job possible given the data. Remember,

>All models are wrong. Some are useful.

```{r summaryoutput, echo=FALSE}
question("From the output of `summary`, what is the slope of the regression line?",
         answer(".64629", correct = TRUE),
         answer("0.4114", message = "That's the standard error for `parent`."),
         answer("23.94153", message = "That's the line's intercept with 0 on the y axis."),
         correct = "You're the best!",
         incorrect = "Not quite.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
```{r summaryoutput2, echo=FALSE}
question("From the output of `summary`, what is the standard error of the slope?",
         answer(".64629", message = "That's the correlation coefficient."),
         answer("0.4114", correct = TRUE),
         answer("23.94153", message = "That's the line's intercept with 0 on the y axis."),
         correct = "You are amazing!",
         incorrect = "Not quite.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
```{r summaryoutput3, echo=FALSE}
question("From the output of `summary`, what is the intercept?",
         answer(".64629", message = "That's the correlation coefficient."),
         answer("0.4114", message = "That's the standard error for `parent`."),
         answer("23.94153", correct = TRUE),
         correct = "All that practice is paying off!",
         incorrect = "Not quite.",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

>Random fact: Charles Darwin and Francis Galton were cousins.


The slope of a line shows how much of a change in the
vertical direction is produced by a change in the horizontal
direction. So, parents "1 inch" above the mean in height tend
to have children who are only .65 inches above the mean. The
green triangle illustrates this point. From the mean, moving
a "1 inch distance" horizontally to the right (increasing the
parents' height) produces a ".65 inch" increase in the
vertical direction (children's height).

A coefficient will be within 2 standard errors of its
estimate about 95% of the time. This means the slope of our
regression is significantly different than either 0 or 1
since `(.64629) +/- (2 * .04114)` is near neither 0 nor 1.

Nuff said. Let's do some more code.

See if you can figure out how to add two cyan lines to indicate the means of the
children's heights (horizontal) and the parents' (vertical).
Note that these lines and the regression line all intersect
in a point. Pretty cool, huh? We'll talk more about this in a
later lesson. (Something you can look forward to.) Copy your plot from above and use `?abline` for help to figure out how to make these lines. Here are some hints:

* `mean(galton$child)` will give you mean chidren's heights.    
* `mean(galton$parent)` will do the obvious---give you mean parents' heights.    
* Tell `abline`, `v = ` for where you want a vertical line and `h = ` for where you want a horizontal line.

```{r alllines, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 15}

```
```{r alllines-hint-1}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
abline(regrline, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
abline(..., lwd = 3, col = "cyan")
abline(..., lwd = 3, col = "cyan")
```
```{r alllines-solution}
plot(jitter(child, 4) ~ parent, galton)
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
abline(regrline, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
abline(v = mean(galton$parent), lwd = 3, col = "cyan")
abline(h = mean(galton$child), lwd = 3, col = "cyan")
```


Similarly, parents who are 1 inch below average in height
have children who are only .65 inches below average height.
The purple triangle illustrates this. From the mean, moving a
"1 inch distance" horizontally to the left (decreasing the
parents' height) produces a ".65 inch" decrease in the
vertical direction (children's height).




## But I like Math. Where's the Math?

Here are some fun facts and exercises related to Galton's data. First, a couple of histograms.

```{r galton,fig.height=3.5,fig.width=8}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(galton$child, col = "blue", breaks = 100)
hist(galton$parent, col = "blue", breaks = 100)
```

### Finding the middle via least squares

* Consider only the children's heights. 
* How could one describe the "middle"?
* One definition, let $Y_i$ be the height of child $i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n = 928$, then define the middle as the value of $\mu$
that minimizes $$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2$$
* This is physical center of mass of the histrogram.
* You might have guessed that the answer $\mu = \bar X$.


### The least squares estimate is the empirical mean
```{r lsm, dependson="galton",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
hist(galton$child, col = "blue", breaks = 100)
meanChild <- mean(galton$child)
lines(rep(meanChild,100), seq(0, 150, length = 100), col = "red",lwd = 5)
```

### The math follows as
$$ 
\begin{align} 
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2 & = \
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y + \bar Y - \mu)^2 \\ 
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)  (\bar Y - \mu) +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 (\bar Y - \mu) \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)  +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 (\bar Y - \mu)  (\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i - n \bar Y) +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2\\ 
& \geq \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 \
\end{align} 
$$


### Comparing childrens' heights and their parents' heights

```{r, dependson="galton",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(galton$parent, jitter(galton$child, 4), pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

Since that's a little hard to read, let's use the following code, in which the size of each point represents number of points at that (X, Y) combination.

```{r freqGalton, dependson="galton",fig.height=6,fig.width=6,echo=TRUE}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
plot(as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$parent)), 
     as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$child)),
     pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
     cex = .15 * freqData$freq, 
     xlab = "parent", ylab = "child")
```


### Visualizing the best fit line
The sizes of the points indicate frequencies at each X, Y combination.

```{r, fig.height=5,fig.width=5,echo=FALSE}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
plot(as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$parent)), 
     as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$child)),
     pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
     cex = .05 * freqData$freq, 
     xlab = "parent", ylab = "child")
lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
lines(galton$parent,lm1$fitted,col="red",lwd=3)
```
